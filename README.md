# Python Workshop

This is a hands-on workshop which aims to teach practical Python programming skills.

By the end of the workshop you will have written two real-world projects in Python:

1. An AWS Lambda function which uses the AWS Python SDK ([boto][1])
1. A command-line utility

TODO - explain what the projects do.

To give you the understanding and skills required for writing real-world projects, we will go
through the following topics:

- What is Python?
- 2 or 3?
- Setting up Your Work Environment
- Using the Interactive Shell
- Data Types
- Flow Control
- Data Structures
- Importing Modules
- Dependency Management
- Error Handling
- Logging
- Testing

>NOTE: This repository was created for an internal Python workshop at [AllCloud][2].
